# Traffic-Control-System
It is an Arduino based Project. In this project we use 4 ultrasonic sensor to calculate distance or traffic, 4 servomotor for brigading the way and a Arduino Uno to control servo motor on the basis of ulrasonic sensor data.

It is fully automatic system we need to setup once then there is no need to handle this system as this is a fully automatic system.
The increase in urbanization and traffic congestion create an urgent need to operate our transportation systems with maximum efficiency. Real-time traffic signal control is an integral part of modern Urban Traffic Control Systems aimed at achieving optimal Utilization of the road network. Providing effective real time traffic signal control for a large complex traffic network is an extremely challenging distributed control problem. Signal system operation is further complicated by the recent trend that views traffic signal system as a small component of an integrated multimodal transportation System. Optimization of traffic signals and other control devices for the efficient movement of traffic on streets and highways constitutes a challenging part of the advanced traffic management system of intelligent transportation system.
